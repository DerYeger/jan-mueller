          In 2021, I finished my bachelor's degree in computer science at the
          University of Kassel. Currently, I am studying Software Engineering &
          Internet Computing at the TU Wien. In parallel, I am a working student
          at Senacor Technologies AG.

        Programming is one of my hobbies in particular. I work on various open
        source and hobby projects, which I use as a platform for learning. In
        the process, I strive for iterative improvements of my source code to
        constantly develop my style, architecture, and programming-related
        knowledge.

        I am active in both backend and frontend development. In the latter
        field, I am developing websites and Android apps. I am not averse to the
        theoretical aspects of software development and like to deal with
        algorithms, data structures, or the big O notation, among others. In
        internships as a software developer as well as multiple jobs as a grader
        and tutor at the University of Kassel, I was able to expand my skills
        and pass them on to other students.

        I find my inspiration while listening to music, walking, and reading,
        where I like to lose myself in science fiction worlds like Frank
        Herbert's Dune. Both melancholic songs by Ben Howard and breathtaking
        soundtracks of my favorite video games accompany me during hours of
        programming and inspire me to look for solutions to even the trickiest
        problems.
