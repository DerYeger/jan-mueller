## Introduction

[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) is a great free alternative to Google Maps and Apple Maps.
In this blog post, I demonstrate how to use [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com) for adding interactive maps to React websites, implementing performant markers, and finally supporting SSR environments such as Astro and Next.js.

Please note that I'm using type imports of [Preact](https://preactjs.com) instead of React, since it decreases the size of my blog's client-side JavaScript bundles.
Preact has a React compatibility mode, so the imports are the only difference from a React implementation.
In the following code snippets, I'll add notes about differences to React as comments.

## Creating a Reusable Component

<LeafletMap client:only="preact" />

### Installation

First, we need to install the packages `leaflet`, `@types/leaflet`, and [`react-leaflet`](https://react-leaflet.js.org/):

```bash
yarn install leaflet react-leaflet
yarn install -D @types/leaflet
```

Leaflet will handle the visualization and interactivity of our maps.
`react-leaflet` includes various React components that provide bindings to Leaflet's DOM rendering, making it a lot simpler to integrate with a React application.

### Implementation

Below is the code for a basic reusable map component.
I'll explain the important points in detail.

1. The `children` prop is used to make the component reusable.
   It enables us to include various elements, such as [markers](#adding-markers).
2. By also using `MapOptions` as the props type, it's possible to pass any of [Leaflet's options](https://leafletjs.com/reference.html#map-option) directly to the map.
3. It's important to give the `MapContainer` a height.
   In this example, I used Tailwind's utility `h-[200px]`.
4. `TileLayer` handles the visualization and design of our map.
   Leaflet allows us to specify a [provider](https://github.com/leaflet-extras/leaflet-providers) for tile layers.
   Previews and instructions for various providers can be found [here](https://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/).
   Keep in mind that not all of them are free, so always check their individual terms and conditions.
   (And don't forget to add the correct attribution!)
   In this blog, I am using [Basemaps styles from CARTO](https://github.com/CartoDB/basemap-styles).
5. Styling!
   Leaflet's styles have to be imported manually, as described next in [Styling](#styling).

```tsx
import type { MapOptions } from 'leaflet'
// React: import type { FC, ReactNode } from 'react'
import type { ComponentChildren, FunctionalComponent } from 'preact'
import { MapContainer, TileLayer } from 'react-leaflet'

const LeafletMap: FunctionalComponent<
  {
    center: [number, number]
    children: ComponentChildren
    zoom: number
  } & MapOptions
> = ({ children, ...options }) => {
  return (
    <MapContainer className="h-[200px] w-full" maxZoom={18} {...options}>
      <TileLayer
        attribution='&copy; <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors &copy; <a href="https://carto.com/attributions">CARTO</a>'
        url="https://{s}.basemaps.cartocdn.com/rastertiles/voyager/{z}/{x}/{y}{r}.png"
      />
      {children}
    </MapContainer>
  )
}

export default LeafletMap
```

Our new `LeafletMap` component can be used as seen below.
For now, we will not make use of the `children` prop and pass an empty fragment instead.

```tsx
<LeafletMap center={center} zoom={13}>
  <></>
</LeafletMap>
```

### Styling

Setting up Leaflet's is straight forward.
Just add the following import to your project:

```ts
import 'leaflet/dist/leaflet.css'
```

> Note: With Next.js, you may need to import the styles in your project's `global.css`.

If you have any modals, sticky elements or similar content on your website, maps will render above these elements.
For some reason, certain elements of Leaflet's maps come with `z-index` of 400!
A simple fix for this issue is settings the `z-index` of the offending elements back to 0.

```css
.leaflet-bottom,
.leaflet-control,
.leaflet-pane,
.leaflet-top {
  z-index: 0 !important;
}
```

## Adding Markers

<LeafletMapWithMarkers client:only="preact" />

The default marker icons of Leaflet will not work with Next.js out of the box, since they are imported with `require` statements.
In this section, I will create a custom marker icon for my maps.

In this example, I copied the required files to the `public/static/leaflet` directory of my Astro project and specified them in the code below.

> You may use Leaflet's files for marker icons by copying them from `node_modules/leaflet/dist/images/*.png` to your `public` directory.

While the `iconSize` and `shadowSize` should obviously match the dimensions of provided images, the values of `iconAnchor` and `shadowAnchor` are not trivial.
The former should be equal to `[iconWidth / 2, iconHeight / 2]`, if your marker has a centered tip at the bottom, like the one used in this example.
I had to experiment with Leaflet's marker shadow to find the right anchor, and in the end `shadowAnchor: [12, 41]` resulted in perfect alignment.
Your mileage may vary with other images!

```ts
import { Marker, icon } from 'leaflet'

Marker.prototype.options.icon = icon({
  iconUrl: '/static/leaflet/map-marker.svg',
  iconRetinaUrl: '/static/leaflet/map-marker.svg',
  iconSize: [24, 24],
  iconAnchor: [12, 24],
  shadowUrl: '/static/leaflet/marker-shadow.png',
  shadowRetinaUrl: '/static/leaflet/marker-shadow.png',
  shadowSize: [41, 41],
  shadowAnchor: [12, 41],
})
```

Now, our markers can be added to maps as seen in the snippet below:

```tsx
import { Marker } from 'react-leaflet'

const center: [number, number] = [48.2082, 16.3738]
const markers: [number, number][] = [center, [48.2, 16.37], [48.1987, 16.3685]]

<LeafletMap center={center} zoom={13}>
  {markers.map((position, index) => (
    <Marker key={index} position={position} />
  ))}
</LeafletMap>
```

### Improving Performance

<LeafletMapWithClusters client:only="preact" />

The code above works fine for the few example markers, but it has various downsides:

- Adding **many markers** will **cripple performance**, as React will struggle to keep up with thousands of `<Marker>` elements.
- **Zooming out will** result in **markers obstructing each other**, and will most definitely not be able to show locations at a glance.

Fortunately, [Leaflet.markercluster](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.markercluster) fixes this issue by grouping markers that are too close together in clusters!
By using marker clusters, we prevent too many markers being rendered at once, as well as markers being too close together.

There are a few React-specific wrappers for Leaflet.markercluster, but most of them will not work with React 18.
After scouring GitHub issues for some time, I found [@changey/react-leaflet-markercluster](https://github.com/changey/react-leaflet-markercluster).
While it doesn't provide type definitions (how unfortunate!), it works with React 18.
It can be installed as follows:

```bash
yarn install @changey/react-leaflet-markercluster
```

And there are more good news; using this library is not difficult either.
Analogously to our map, we'll create a reusable `<MarkerCluster>` component.
The library comes with a styled cluster icon by default.
The custom icon below is for demonstration, as it allows me to align the style of my marker and cluster icons.

```tsx
// @ts-expect-error Missing type definitions
import BaseMarkerCluster from '@changey/react-leaflet-markercluster'
import { divIcon, point } from 'leaflet'
// React: import type { FC, ReactNode } from 'react'
import type { ComponentChildren, FunctionalComponent } from 'preact'

const createClusterCustomIcon = (cluster: any) => {
  return divIcon({
    html: `<span>${cluster.getChildCount()}</span>`,
    className:
      'bg-[#e74c3c] bg-opacity-100 text-white font-bold !flex items-center justify-center rounded-3xl border-white border-4 border-opacity-50',
    iconSize: point(40, 40, true),
  })
}

export const MarkerCluster: FunctionalComponent<{
  children: ComponentChildren
}> = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <BaseMarkerCluster
      iconCreateFunction={createClusterCustomIcon}
      showCoverageOnHover={false}
    >
      {children}
    </BaseMarkerCluster>
  )
}
```

To use marker clusters, simply wrap your `<Marker>` elements in a `<MarkerCluster>`:

```tsx
<LeafletMap center={center} zoom={13}>
  <MarkerCluster>
    {markers.map((position, index) => (
      <Marker key={index} position={position} />
    ))}
  </MarkerCluster>
</LeafletMap>
```

## Supporting SSR

If you have tried using `react-leaflet` in an SSR context, you'll also have encountered the dreaded `window is not defined`.
I won't make any false promises, the maps won't actually be rendered on the server; Leaflet just doesn't support that.
However, we will be able to skip Leaflet in SSR environments and hydrate our maps client-side.

To achieve that, we will use React 18's [`React.lazy`](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#reactlazy).
A separate file is required for _lazily importing_ our existing components, e.g., `LeafletMap.lazy.tsx`.

```tsx
// React: import React, { Suspense, lazy } from 'react'
import { Suspense, lazy } from 'preact/compat'

const LazyLeafletMap = lazy(() => import('./LeafletMap'))
const LazyMarker = lazy(async () => (await import('react-leaflet')).Marker)
const LazyMarkerCluster = lazy(
  async () => (await import('./LeafletMap')).MarkerCluster
)
```

In the same file, declare a new component as follows:

```tsx
import type { MapOptions } from 'leaflet'
// React: import type { FC } from 'react'
import type { FunctionalComponent } from 'preact'
// React: import React, { Suspense, lazy } from 'react'
import { Suspense, lazy } from 'preact/compat'

export const LeafletMapWithClusters: FunctionalComponent<
  {
    center: [number, number]
    markers: [number, number][]
  } & MapOptions
> = ({ center, markers, ...options }) => {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div className="h-[200px]" />}>
      <LazyLeafletMap center={center} zoom={13} {...options}>
        <Suspense fallback={<></>}>
          <LazyMarkerCluster>
            {markers.map((position, index) => (
              <LazyMarker key={index} position={position} />
            ))}
          </LazyMarkerCluster>
        </Suspense>
      </LazyLeafletMap>
    </Suspense>
  )
}
```

Update all usages of our initial map component to use the newly created component, and you're good to go!
... unless you're using Next.js or Astro.
If that's the case, I still got you covered.
Just keep reading!

### Astro

With Astro, you also need to update the usage of your lazy components, to include `client:only="preact"` (or `client:only="react"` depending on your setup).
For example, an import of the first example map in this `.mdx` blog looks like this:

```mdx
import { LeafletMap } from '~/components/blog/examples/LeafletMap.lazy.tsx'

<LeafletMap client:only="preact" />
```

> Note: At the time of writing, Astro may throw an error when importing your Preact component this way, see [withastro/astro#3833](https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues/3833).
> As described [here](https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues/3833#issuecomment-1175827464), a workaround is importing `preact` in the offending file.

### Next.js

Making Leaflet work with Next.js is not much different.
Instead of using React's `lazy`, we can make use of Next's `dynamic` with `ssr: false` to skip rendering Leaflet components on the server:

```tsx
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

export const LazyMap = dynamic(() => import('./LeafletMap'), { ssr: false })

export const LazyMarker = dynamic(
  async () => (await import('react-leaflet')).Marker,
  {
    ssr: false,
  }
)

export const LazyMarkerCluster = dynamic(
  async () => (await import('./LeafletMap')).MarkerCluster,
  {
    ssr: false,
  }
)
```

Now, all the `<Lazy...>` components can be used even without `<Suspense>` in any other component or page.

## Conclusion

Leaflet and `react-leaflet` are powerful libraries for working with OpenStreetMap.
With some tweaking regarding icon configurations, lazy loading, and custom providers, they enable great looking and interactive maps on any React environment.

Markers in combination with marker clusters make it possible to render large amounts of locations with good performance and usability in mind.
