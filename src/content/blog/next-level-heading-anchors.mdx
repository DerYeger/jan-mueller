## Introduction

[Astro](https://astro.build) enables powerful customization of Markdown pages by using [rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype) plugins.
In this guide, I'll teach you how to automatically create next-level anchor links for headings with Astro and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).
In the following sections, I'll assume basic knowledge about the used technologies.

If you have already worked with heading anchors on a site that has a sticky header (like this one), you will know that navigating to an anchor by its slug (e.g., `#introduction`) will result in the heading being obstructed by the header.
By following the guide below, you will end up with anchor links that avoid this issue.

## Configuring rehype

To get started, add the `@astrojs/mdx` and `@astrojs/tailwind` integrations to your project.
We will also need the following packages:

```bash
pnpm install -D rehype-autolink-headings hastscript hast-util-to-string
```

Then, we will update Astro's config `astro.config.mjs` to automatically generate the links.
I have taken quite a bit of this configuration from the [official Astro doc's config](https://github.com/withastro/docs/blob/main/astro.config.ts), including their `AnchorLinkIcon` and `createSROnlyLabel`.
However, I couldn't get the rehype plugins working unless I configured them in the config of the `@astrojs/mdx` integration.

```js
import mdx from '@astrojs/mdx'
import tailwind from '@astrojs/tailwind'
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'
import { toString } from 'hast-util-to-string'
import { h } from 'hastscript'
import autolinkHeadings from 'rehype-autolink-headings'

// The following configuration for rehype-autolink-headings was taken from https://github.com/withastro/docs/blob/main/astro.config.ts
const AnchorLinkIcon = h(
  'svg',
  {
    width: 16,
    height: 16,
    version: 1.1,
    viewBox: '0 0 16 16',
    xlmns: 'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg',
  },
  h('path', {
    fillRule: 'evenodd',
    fill: 'currentcolor',
    d: 'M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z',
  }),
)

const createSROnlyLabel = (text) => {
  const node = h('span.sr-only', `Section titled ${escape(text)}`)
  node.properties['is:raw'] = true
  return node
}

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    mdx({
      rehypePlugins: {
        extends: [
          [
            autolinkHeadings,
            {
              behavior: 'append',
              group: ({ tagName }) =>
                h(`div.heading-wrapper.level-${tagName}`, {
                  tabIndex: -1,
                }),
              content: (heading) => [
                h(
                  `span.anchor-icon`,
                  {
                    ariaHidden: 'true',
                  },
                  AnchorLinkIcon,
                ),
                createSROnlyLabel(toString(heading)),
              ],
            },
          ],
        ],
      },
    }),
    tailwind(),
    // ...remaining integrations
  ],
  // ...remaining config
})
```

Now all of your headings in `.mdx` files should have anchors and IDs!
The labels for screen readers are already hidden by Tailwind's styles for the `.sr-only` class we applied.

Unfortunately, icons will not be aligned with their headings, and navigating to a heading via its slug will result in it being obstructed by the header.
We will fix that in the next section!

## Issues and workarounds

Here's what we need to achieve:

1. Align the anchor icon with the heading's text
2. Prevent a sticky header from obstructing headings when navigating by slugs

### Anchor icon alignment

Fixing the alignment of anchor icons is trivial using Flexbox.
An intuitive solution for the problem are the following Tailwind utilities:

```css
@layer components {
  *:is(h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6) {
    @apply flex items-center gap-2;
  }
}
```

### Heading offset

Next, we will prevent a sticky header from overlaying headings by using the `scroll-margin-top` property.
In addition to the height of the header, you may also consider adding any `padding` of the Markdown's container element to the scroll-margin.
In the case of my blog, this is `48px` (height of the header) + `32px` (padding of `main`) = `80px`.
This translates to Tailwind's `scroll-mt-20` utility.

```css
@layer components {
  *:is(h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6) {
    @apply scroll-mt-20;
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

Setting up automatic anchor generation is not that difficult, thanks to `rehype-autolink-headers`.
While they require some styling to work well with sticky headers, Tailwind CSS reduces this to a few lines of code.

We ended up with the following CSS to create accessible anchors and headings that won't be obstructed by headers.

```css
@layer components {
  *:is(h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6) {
    @apply flex items-center gap-2 scroll-mt-20;
  }
}
```

> You may need to increase specificity of the selectors depending on your markup, e.g., `article *:is(h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6)`.

## Changelog

- **20th August 2022**: A reader informed me that my previous solution for the heading offset could be simplified by using the `scroll-margin-top` property described above.
  I updated this guide accordingly.
