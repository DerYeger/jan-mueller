about:
  facts: Jan // {age} // B.Sc. // Software Engineer // Vienna
  intro: In 2021, I finished my bachelor's degree in computer science at the University of Kassel. Currently, I am studying <mark>Software Engineering & Internet Computing</mark> at the <mark>TU Wien</mark>. In parallel, I am a working student at <mark>Senacor Technologies AG<mark/>.
  hobbies: Programming is one of my hobbies in particular. I work on various <mark>open source</mark> and <mark>hobby projects</mark>, which I use as a platform for learning. In the process, I strive for iterative improvements of my source code to constantly develop my style, architecture, and programming-related knowledge.
  skills: I am active in both <mark>backend</mark> and <mark>frontend</mark> <mark>development</mark>. In the latter field, I am developing websites and Android apps. I am not averse to the theoretical aspects of software development and like to deal with algorithms, data structures, or the big O notation, among others. In internships as a software developer as well as multiple jobs as a grader and tutor at the University of Kassel, I was able to expand my skills and pass them on to other students.
  inspiration: I find my inspiration while listening to <mark>music</mark>, <mark>walking</mark>, and <mark>reading</mark>, where I like to lose myself in science fiction worlds like Frank Herbert's Dune. Both melancholic songs by Ben Howard and breathtaking soundtracks of my favorite video games accompany me during hours of programming and inspire me to look for solutions to even the trickiest problems.
