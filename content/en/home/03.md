I am active in both backend and frontend development.
In the latter field, I am developing websites and Android apps.
I am not averse to the theoretical aspects of software development and like to deal with algorithms, data structures, or the big O notation, among others.
In internships as a software developer as well as multiple jobs as a grader and tutor at the University of Kassel, I was able to expand my skills and pass them on to other students.
