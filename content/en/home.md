# About me

*Jan // 22 // B. Sc. // Software Engineer // Kassel*

In 2021, I finished my bachelor's degrees in computer science at the University of Kassel.
During April 2021, I will move to Vienna.
Afterwards, I aim to complete the master's program *Software Engineering & Internet Computing* at the TU Wien.

Programming is one of my hobbies in particular.
I work on various open source and hobby projects, which I use as a platform for learning.
In the process, I strive for iterative improvements of my source code to constantly develop my style, architecture and programming related knowledge.

I am active in both backend and frontend development.
In the latter field, I am developing websites and Android apps.
I am not averse to the theoretical aspects of software development and like to deal with algorithms, data structures or the big O notation, among others.
In internships as a software developer as well as multiple jobs as a grader and tutor at the University of Kassel, I was able to expand my skills and pass them on to other students.

I find my inspiration while listening to music, walking and reading, where I like to lose myself in science fiction worlds like Frank Herbert's *Dune*.
Both melancholic songs by Ben Howard and breathtaking soundtracks of my favorite video games accompany me during hours of programming and inspire me to look for solutions to even the trickiest problems.
