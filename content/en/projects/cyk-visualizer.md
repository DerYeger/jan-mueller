Based on my [implementation of the CYK algorithm](/projects/cyk-algorithm), I created a website for visualizing the evaluation steps.
I used this project to learn Kotlin/JS and create my first React application using Kotlin.

I enjoyed being able to use the Kotlin standard library for business logic.
However, the DSL for creating HTML elements is rather verbose and not as intuitive as working with `.jsx` files.
