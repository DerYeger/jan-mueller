For the course *3D Modeling* at the University of Kassel, I had to model and texture an An-26 in Blender and Substance Painter.
My submission is displayed in the following marmoset viewer.
About 10MB of data are transferred for viewing.
A version with higher texture quality (warning: approx. 35MB) can be found [here](/models/an-26-high-res).
